    According to the man-page, CPU usage is expressed as the % of time spent running during the entire lifetime of a process.
    Ergo âˆ‘CPU(pid) > 100% is possible.

    **Jasdev:**

    I was curious how process IDs were generated, so I did a search on this. Turns out that IDs are generated sequentially (from 0) until a system-dependent maximum value. At this point, the numbers become recycled and regenerated from the beginning. This is the approach most Unix implementations take. Although, more complex schemes have been used [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/aix-faq/part2/section-20.html].

    Pressing '1' in top shows stats on all four cores. It seems like only one core maximizes the 'us' (user space) value. The other 3 cores probably focus on non-user space tasks (background tasks).

    **Jasdev:**

    Noticed that certain process IDs had a trailing '-'. Turns out this is present for 32-bit architectures. On the other hand a '+' is present for 64-bit architectures. Lastly, a '*' is present for non-native architectures. this can be used to sort processes that utilize your native architecture better than others.

    This one stores number of last few bash processes running last hour (7pm) to a txt file.
    ps aux | grep -i 19: | tail | grep -i bash | wc -l > num_of_bash_running_recently_last_hour.txt

    **Jasdev:**

    If you ever have a huge amount of text that you need to use in a pipe but still want it to be readable, simply type:
    pbpaste | ...
    This will pipe your clipboard's output into successive commands which can be super useful for kicking off a long string of them.
